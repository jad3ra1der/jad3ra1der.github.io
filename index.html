        <h2>Computing Applications Major </h2>

        <p>My goals for this course are to begin to establish foundation knowledge in computer science, through both theory and practice. I have a very surface level knowledge of various principles of coding and computer operations, but I have always wanted to expand my abilities into something practical. The barrier of entry into furthering my understanding of computer science has always felt very steep, and I have previously lacked the resources to find a reasonable starting point. My goal is for this class to be the first step into changing that. </p>
        <p>So far, I have made some minute progress towards my goals. The exercises and assignments have both reinforced my current skills and added onto them in valuable ways. However, the discussion posts interrupt the pace of my progress towards my goals, diverting from the topic of the course and into business philosophies. I hope to continue practical assignments such as this one, which contribute valuable skills and information in my field.</p>
        <p>Some Hobbies & Interests of mine:</p>
