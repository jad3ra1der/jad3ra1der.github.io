# Personal Website Project
 
 The goal of this project is to Create an 'index.html' file containing a title, my name in a main heading, my major in a subheading, at least two paragraphs describing my goals for the course, an unordered list with at least three hobbies or interests, and a hyperlink to my GitHub. Then create a Box Element using CSS and add a color scheme to the page.
